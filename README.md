## Summary 

This dashboard examines the results of a survey conducted among a community of data professionals. The dashboard focuses on country, salaries, job titles, favorite programming language, and happiness regarding work-life balance and salaries in current roles. I found these areas interesting to learn more about the data industry and what to expect working in Data. This survey is a small poll of mostly data analysts from the community of "Alex the Analyst". Still, it provides a great starting point for understanding what is important in a data career.

## Insights

Key takeaways are that Python is, hands down, the favorite programming language among data professionals. 417 of the 630 (66.19%) survey takers said that Python is their favorite. Second is R with 15.4% of the votes. That is why I will be learning Python for my data career. Secondly, the difficulty of a career change into Data slightly falls on the difficult side, with the majority stating neither easy nor difficult. Lastly, the happiness related to work/life balance and salaries for data professionals is close to the middle of the road. That could mean data professionals are very logical and recognize that their work/life balance could be improved, but they still have time for their families and hobbies, and the pay could be slightly better, but it's not bad either. The United States actually has the highest levels of happiness in terms of work/life balance and salary. 

## Concerns
The major concerns with the dataset are the low number of survey takers, which may not provide a true reflection of data professionals as a whole. Even after cleaning the data, the "other" option on the survey led to a wide range of different answers. It would require a thorough data cleaning session to sort all the duplicate and unique responses for "Job Title" and "Favorite Programming Language." These "Other" options would have added unnecessary complexity; therefore, I choose to keep "Other" as a single category for this dashboard.
